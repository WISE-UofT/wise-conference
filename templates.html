Visual art is still stuck in the renaissance -- produced manually and sold to the elite through the archaic gallery system. Acrylic is building the world's first way to make painted artwork at scale: robots that paint. Their technology will turn everyday homes, offices and public spaces into galleries with the splendor of the Louvre, the MOMA and the Met, at a fraction of the cost — all while supporting independent artists. Acrylic has been named one of Canada's Top 10 Ventures to Watch (GRIT), awarded Centech's (a UBI Global Top 10 Deeptech Accelerator) Top Tech Innovation Prize, Collision Conference's Top 10 Pitch semi-finalist, and Chloë has won numerous accolades such as Canada's Next 36 Top Entrepreneur, McGill University Entrepreneurial Grit Award, and Women in Tech Global's Tech for Good prize.</p>
