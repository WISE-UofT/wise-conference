                                    Dive into the fascinating world of neuroscience with our hands-on workshop, “Exploring the Brain: From Mouse Moves to Microscope Views”. This interactive workshop is designed for students eager to explore the techniques used to understand brain function and behavior in mouse models.
                                    Participants will learn how to analyze mouse behavior to uncover insights into neural activity and link these findings to histological images of brain tissue. Through guided sessions, you'll gain practical experience with behavioral data analysis, image processing, and the principles behind these essential neuroscience techniques.

                    <p>Abby is a Member of Technical Staff for the Mission Systems department at MDA Space. She is part of the Engineering Support Lead team in the operations world for the Mobile Servicing System on the ISS which includes Canadarm2 and Dextre. She's been with MDA for 4 years (since 2021) and graduated with a bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Alberta. During her undergrad, she was involved with AlbertaSat and later started STARR (Student Team for Alberta Rocketry Research) in 2018. In 2016, she attended the Advanced Space Camp Academy in Huntsville Alabama to train as an astronaut. From her experience at the Academy, it sparked volunteer work during university to do STEM outreach for kids on "training like an astronaut" and now trains astronauts from around the world how to robotically fly the Canadarm2. As much as she loves all things space related, she loves living a life full of hobbies of roller-skating, fashion, cinematography, and raving. She hopes one day to go to space and listen to the entire M83 Junk Album floating in zero-g in awe of the beautiful planet we live on and the universe's vast star collection.

After obtaining her bachelor's degree at the University of Toronto, she pursued her doctoral degree at McGill University under the mentorship of Charles Bourque investigating hydration state-dependent control of vasopressin neuronal excitability. After PhD, began her first postdoctoral training at Thomas Otis laboratory (UCLA) investigating cerebellar circuits and their relationship to motor learning. Next, she pursued a second postdoctoral position at Daniel Geschwind laboratory (also at UCLA) to examine the mechanisms by which CNTNAP2, an autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-linked gene, modifies the function of the central oxytocin system and impacts sociability using a genetic mouse model. In 2020, she established her own laboratory at McMaster University, where she applies a multi-level, integrative research strategy to link how gene mutations associated with psychiatric conditions impact the development and function of the central oxytocin system and social behaviour.

She received her Ph.D from the Lassonde School of Engineering at York University in 2023. Her research focused on finding the building blocks of life in some of the earliest forming rocks in our solar system - carbonaceous meteorites, and built laser-based instrumentation to study such material brought back from the asteroid Bennu as part of the OSIRIS-REx mission. Beth's path to the space industry and systems engineering was not typical, having started her academic career with a bachelors in geology, receiving a masters in science and then museum studies, but believes that she would not be in the position she is in today with out such a range of experiences. Beth is passionate about public STEM education and scientific literacy and has participated in numerous outreach opportunities through the ROM, Science Center and local organizations.

                        Dr. Olivieri has been honoured with many awards including The John Maddox Prize (2023) and the American Association for the Advancement of Science Award for Scientific Freedom and Responsibility: <i>“for indefatigable determination that patient safety and research integrity come before institutional and commercial interests, and for courage in defending these principles in the face of severe consequences.”</i>
